Nowadays, manufacturers are beginning to utilize software to automate validation tasks, which has led to a great reduction in time spent to rate the product through an expert. Thus, in this project, we are going to study the dataset of the red wine by reviewing the usage of various machine learning models used to predict wine quality by previous researches.The input variables of the dataset include volatile acidity, chlorides, fixed acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, total sulfur dioxide, free sulfur dioxide, density, pH, alcohol, and sulfate, white the output variable is quality which has values ranging from 0 to 10, 0 being very bad and 10 being excellent. Through previous work, we have deduced that the dataset studies are unbalanced and will need some resampling work before it is used in the machine learning models. Thus, this work would also propose the use of the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique to balance the dataset before using it in three different machine learning models, which are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K Nearest Neighbour.
